Hello! I am Sol Park, a student in Middle School. This is my first website!!! I wish to do many things on just one website!!! I go to many competitions, such as math, coding, and tennis tournaments. I love going to all of these; math is my traditional, coding is my favorite, and tennis is my old-fashioned.

### More Information

I play tennis, and play some video games. I also love programming as well; duh I just made a website...
