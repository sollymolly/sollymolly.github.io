title: Code Arena!!!!
---

Yayy!!! I found something called Code Arena in Hacker Earth, and now I am doing it; it is so fun!!!

4/3/19 First Win: I didn't get full points though...

4/4/19 Second Win: I printed the sample input and it somehow worked... I don't think HackerEarth should have one of the outputs as the sample one...

4/11/19 Third Win: For some stuid reason I used this technique with rows and column when I could have just used simple functions with if and elses, and only  got 3 test cases.
