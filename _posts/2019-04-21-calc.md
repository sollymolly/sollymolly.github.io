I made a calculator with bootstrap and Javascript.

This is the link to my Calculator!!!

This is how the calculator works:

There are several buttons for my calculator, which leads to many different functions around the calculator. For example, if I press the number 2 button, then the number 2 shows up on the screen. Then, if I press the * button, that also shows in my screen. Behind the scene, the numbers are being recorded, along with the symbols. Now, I press the number 3 button, and press =. Behind the scene, the calculator does 2 * 3 = 6, and shows the number 6.

In this, I used bootstrap and some javascript coding.
