title: Programming Competition #2

Today, I just came from Seattle, Washington to Portland, Oregon to do a Teamscode Coding competition. I am really excited to do it!!! 
I think we are doing it as the Team of Three, but I don't know for sure. Last time, we were the Team of Three at the Mercer Island Competiton 
in March 16th, 2019. I found out that less people come to the Catlin Gabel Competition, so I really really wish that we place this time.
