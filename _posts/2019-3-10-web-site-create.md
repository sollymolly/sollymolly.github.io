Hello, I have taken my Geometry Math Class today and learned about both the law of sines and cosines and all that jazz, but I learned 
something much better and interesting today. 1+1=3. 

Here is the proof: Thanks to Fruit Fresh Art on Youtube for guiding my way!!!

1) Assume a == b == 1

2) Multiply each side by b, making ab == b<sub>2</sub>

3) Subtract both sides by a<sub>2</sub>, making ab - a<sub>2</sub> == b<sub>2</sub> - a<sub>2</sub>

4) Factorize both sides, making a(b - a) == (b + a)(b - a)

5) Simply both sides, making a = a + b

6) Add both sides by 1, which makes a + 1 = a + b + 1

7) Because a == b, a + 1 == a + a + 1, which simplifies to a + 1 = 2a + 1

8) Because a == b == 1, 1 + 1 = 2 + 1

9) Yeet, 1 + 1 = 3.

Linked Lists

Linked List, like arrays, is a linear structure of data. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in the contiguous location ; using pointers, the elements are linked.

Linked Lists are better because:

  1) Dynamic size 
  
  2) Facility of insertion / deletion

To Insert something:

def push(self, new_data):

    new = Node(new_data) 
    
    new.next = self.head
    
    self.head = new
