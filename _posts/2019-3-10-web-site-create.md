title: Totally not Clickbait

Hello, I have taken my Geometry Math Class today and learned about both the law of sines and cosines and all that jazz, but I learned 
something much better and interesting today. 1+1=3. 

Here is the proof: Thanks to Fruit Fresh Art on Youtube for guiding my way!!!

1) Assume a == b == 1

2) Multiply each side by b, making ab == b<sub>2</sub>

3) Subtract both sides by a<sub>2</sub>, making ab - a<sub>2</sub> == b<sub>2</sub> - a<sub>2</sub>

4) Factorize both sides, making a(b - a) == (b + a)(b - a)

5) Simply both sides, making a = a + b

6) Add both sides by 1, which makes a + 1 = a + b + 1

7) Because a == b, a + 1 == a + a + 1, which simplifies to a + 1 = 2a + 1

8) Because a == b == 1, 1 + 1 = 2 + 1

9) Yeet, 1 + 1 = 3.

title: The Big O
---
Hello World, 3/21/2019.

I recently relearned about the Big O notation.

The Big O Notation is the measurement of the time it takes to execute a code.

O(N<sub>2<sub>) => This is the slowest possible time. The time it takes to execute the code exponentially increases per input(data) file.
  
O(N) => This increases linearly per input file; essentially y = x.

O(log(N)) => This is really fast. It linearly increases, like the O(N), however, when the O(N) increases the time by 1, this way increase the time by log(1)

O(1) => This is the fastest possible way of coding. No matter how many inputs are put in, it takes exactly 1 unit of time.

And that is for my big O notation.
